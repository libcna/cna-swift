"""Falsifiability controls for the native ABI verifier.

Each control plants one realistic defect of a named class, runs
`tools/native_abi/verify.py` unchanged, and requires it to fail. A gate that
has never been shown to fail is not evidence, so this is a gate of its own: a
surviving mutation is reported as a failure here.

Every mutation is a single exact textual substitution and is undone in a
`finally`, and the harness re-reads each touched file at the end to prove the
tree is byte-identical to how it started.
