"""Gate over every *normative* status claim in this repository's prose.

`plan.md` opened with "Foundation Milestones 1 through 47 are complete" while
the tree was at Foundation 57 and `NEXT.md` said so: a normative statement had
drifted ten milestones behind the work it describes, and nothing compared them.
`docs/generated/native-abi-report.json` had drifted further still -- it was last
written at `BOUND_FUNCTIONS=55` while a live run answers 87 -- so the generated
report a reader is told to trust over the prose was itself the stale one.

This tool exists so neither can happen again. It has two halves.

**Freshness.** A generated report is only evidence if it is what a live run
produces now. With `--symbol-graph` the strict verifier, the missing-type
inventory and the dependency graph are regenerated into a temporary directory
and required to be byte-identical to the committed copies; with `--cna-include`
and `--library` the native ABI report is regenerated and compared the same way.
A stale committed report fails the gate rather than being read as truth.

**Claims.** Every `KEY=VALUE` token in the normative documents whose KEY is one
this gate derives from a generated report must carry the derived value, and
every normative Foundation-status claim must name the current Foundation. The
current Foundation is the highest `docs/foundation-<N>-*-evidence.md` on disk,
so it moves when a milestone lands its evidence and cannot be edited into
agreement on its own.

Historical prose is not policed and is not deleted: a region between
`<!-- status-gate:historical -->` and `<!-- status-gate:/historical -->` (or the
end of the file) is skipped, which is what lets `NEXT.md` keep the Foundation
30-36 handoff and its Foundation 36 numbers verbatim.
