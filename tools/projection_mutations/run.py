"""Falsifiability controls for the projected exception payloads.

The payload of a projected CLR/XNA exception has four separately observable
parts — the class, the composed `Message`, `ParamName` and `HResult` — and a
test suite that asserted only the message would pass on a defect in any of the
other three. This harness plants one realistic defect at a time, runs the
tests, and requires them to fail; a surviving mutation is reported as a failure
of this gate.

Every mutation is one exact textual substitution, undone in a `finally`, and
the tree is proven byte-identical afterwards.
