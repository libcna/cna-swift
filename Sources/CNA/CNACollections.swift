// BCL collection support projection.
//
// A CLR class used as the direct base of an XNA class must not silently
// disappear. `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GameComponentCollection` derives from
// `System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection<IGameComponent>`, and the four
// `Model*Collection` types derive from `ReadOnlyCollection<T>`; the whole
// usable surface of every one of them is inherited, so dropping the base to
// `Object` would leave the subclass with nothing, and flattening it to a Swift
// `Array` would discard both the reference identity and the live view the CLR
// families are built on.
//
// The rule this file implements is therefore: a CLR BCL base class with a
// registered projection becomes a REAL Swift superclass, and the CLR generic
// argument is preserved in the specialization.
//
//     GameComponentCollection : CNACollection<any IGameComponent>
//
// The three types below live outside `Microsoft.Xna.Framework`. They are
// language- and BCL-support API, not XNA types and not XNA identities, and are
// counted in no XNA scoreboard. Their shape is nevertheless measured, against
// the pinned selected-BCL manifest in
// `tools/api_compat/reference/bcl40-selected-shape.json`, which is
// reconstructed from the hash-registered Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0
// `mscorlib` — see `docs/foundation-26-bcl-authority-evidence.md`.
//
// None of the three conforms to `Sendable`. Two of them are `open`, so a
// subclass anywhere may add mutable stored state and neither this file nor the
// compiler can make a cross-actor promise on its behalf; the third holds
// mutable storage of its own. `mscorlib` makes no thread-safety promise for
// any of them either, and `@unchecked Sendable` would assert exactly the
// guarantee that cannot be earned here.

/// The `EqualityComparer<T>.Default` projection.
///
/// `List<T>.IndexOf` — which every search on both collection families
/// ultimately reaches — compares with `EqualityComparer<T>.Default`. That
/// comparer is resolved by the CLR *at runtime from the element type*: it uses
/// `IEquatable<T>` when the type implements it, otherwise the virtual
/// `Object.Equals`, which is reference identity for a class that does not
/// override it.
///
/// Swift can resolve the same question the same way. A dynamic conformance to
/// `Equatable` is the analogue of `IEquatable<T>` and of an overridden
/// `Object.Equals`, and it is preferred exactly as the CLR prefers them;
/// otherwise two class instances are compared by identity, which is what
/// `Object.Equals` reduces to. The correspondence holds in all four cases that
/// occur:
///
/// | element | CLR | here |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | class, no equality of its own | `Object.Equals` → identity | identity |
/// | class with its own equality | `IEquatable<T>` / overridden `Equals` | `Equatable` |
/// | value type with equality | `EqualityComparer<T>.Default` | `Equatable` |
/// | value type with none | `ValueType.Equals`, field-wise | **not equal** |
///
/// The last row is the one divergence, and it is stated rather than hidden: a
/// Swift value type that does not conform to `Equatable` has no equality for
/// this code to use, and the CLR's reflective field-wise fallback is not
/// reconstructible from it. Every specialization the pinned XNA contract
/// actually declares — `IGameComponent`, `Effect`, `ModelBone`, `ModelMesh`,
/// `ModelMeshPart` — is a reference type, so no projected XNA surface reaches
