    // Pinned in Microsoft.Xna.Framework.dll as a public, non-sealed class
    // extending System.Object, with a public parameterless constructor and
    // four read/write Vector3 properties. Despite the Audio namespace it is
    // pure managed *data*: it holds 3D listener state and depends on nothing
    // but Vector3. No XACT engine, audio device or sound backend is involved
    // in anything it does; the engine appears only in `Cue.Apply3D`, which
    // consumes a listener and is not implemented. Constructing one claims no
    // audio capability.
    //
    // Storage mirrors the pinned IL rather than being simplified, because the
    // IL's XACT-space storage is publicly observable. The instance holds an
    // `XACT_LISTENER_DATA` interop structure in X3DAudio's left-handed space,
    // and every accessor passes through `UnsafeNativeStructures.FlipHandedness`,
    // which is exactly `Vector3(v.X, v.Y, -v.Z)`.
    //
    // The flip is a bitwise involution -- negating twice restores the original
    // bit pattern, negative zero and NaN payloads included -- so a value
    // written and read back comes out unchanged and the flip is invisible for
    // round-trips. It is *not* invisible in the defaults: the constructor
    // seeds `_Position` and `_Velocity` with `Vector3.Zero` **without**
    // flipping, while the getters flip on the way out, so the default
    // `Position` and `Velocity` have a **negative zero** Z. `Forward` and `Up`
    // are seeded through the flip and therefore read back as exactly
    // `Vector3.Forward` and `Vector3.Up`. A "just store the value" projection
    // would silently get the first two wrong.
